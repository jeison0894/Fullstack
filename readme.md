# Fullstack project with Angular and Express

In this project I combine my knowledge of backend and frontend, creating an interface with Angular that thanks to its interaction with a server created in Express and NodeJS shows on the screen a series of data obtained from a database created in MySQL and hosted on Clever Cloud. 

All the deployment was done on Heroku and you can view the final work here.
